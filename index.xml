      <description>Dungeon like is a project I started after learning some Godot. I wanted to create a fully featured game with Godot so I picked a game genre that I felt had a small enough scope for me to complete. Vampire survivors and Brotato were very popular at the time so I decided to use them as inspiration for my game.
The game is a Topdown 2D bullet heaven where I chose to use bought assets to dedicate the time to using the Godot engine and not creating the art myself.</description>

      <description>Bug invasion was part of GitHub Game Off 2021 which is a annual game jam where you get one month to create a game based on one theme. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Bug&amp;rdquo; so the first thing I did was to brainstorm ideas. After removing &amp;ldquo;ant simulation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fly tapper&amp;rdquo; I landed on a game where the bugs in a computer is getting destroyed by the player or &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo;. I chose the Unity game engine because of my past experience with it.</description>

      <description>Oil Spillage was my first big project with a total of 11 members. We were a group of game programmers and technical artists who were divided in different groups with different focus. My group was called the &amp;ldquo;graphics engine&amp;rdquo; where me and one other classmate was part of. We planned to have each object added to the engine before drawing instead of each frame to maximize performance. When the first triangle was on the screen I started to implement meshes and textures for the objects.</description>

      <description>In this project we were 6 people in total and were tasked to create a game with DirectX 11 and C++. We landed on animal fighter with a gun-game mechanic. Each time you defeat an opponent you switch to the next animal. Having the last animal and defeating someone makes you the winner. We had our own group room where we could meet and work together and plan the game and choose what each member should do.</description>
