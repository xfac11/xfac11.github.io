      <description>Dungeon like is a project I started after learning some Godot. I wanted to create a fully featured game with Godot so I picked a game genre that I felt had a small enough scope for me to complete. Vampire survivors and Brotato were very popular at the time so I decided to use them as inspiration for my game.
The game is a Topdown 2D bullet heaven where I chose to use bought assets to dedicate the time to using the Godot engine and not creating the art myself.</description>
