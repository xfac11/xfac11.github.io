I wanted to create a fully featured game with Godot so I picked a game genre that I felt had a small enough scope for me to complete. Vampire survivors and Brotato were very popular at the time so I decided to use them as inspiration for my game.\nThe game is a Topdown 2D bullet heaven where I chose to use bought assets to dedicate the time to using the Godot engine and not creating the art myself.","date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blist.vercel.app/en/blog/dungeon-like/","tags":["Godot","GDScript"],"title":"Dungeon-Like"},{"author":"Filip Karlsson","categories":null,"contents":"Bug invasion was part of GitHub Game Off 2021 which is a annual game jam where you get one month to create a game based on one theme.

After removing \u0026ldquo;ant simulation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;fly tapper\u0026rdquo; I landed on a game where the bugs in a computer is getting destroyed by the player or \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo;.
